                <p class="q">Define the internet backbone in your own words.</p>
                <pre>   The internet backbone is the central network of high-speed connections and infrastructure that forms the core of the internet.
    It links major data centers, internet service providers (ISPs), and regional networks, enabling global communication and data transfer.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</p>
                <pre>   A server is a powerful computer that provides resources and services to clients. Clients are computers that use a service that the server provides.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware
                    components are part of the internet.</p>
                <pre>
    Servers: Store and deliver data or services (websites, emails).
    Routers: Direct data packets between networks, ensuring they reach the correct destination.
    Switches: Connect devices within a local network, enabling communication between them.
    Workstations: End-user devices (computers, smartphones) that act as clients.
    Other Hardware: Includes modems, cables, and data centers that support connectivity and data storage.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms,
                    outlining how this Protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server
                    relationships.</p>
                <pre>   Application Layer: Handles high-level protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
    Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP) or fast, connectionless transfer (UDP).
    Internet Layer: Manages IP addressing and routing (IPv4, IPv6).
    Network Access Layer: Deals with physical connections (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.
                </p>
                <pre>   Web Browsing: Clients (browsers) request web pages from servers.
    Email: Clients (email apps) send and retrieve emails from mail servers.
    Streaming Services: Clients (devices) request video/audio content from media servers.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">What is Hypertext?</p>
                <pre>   Hypertext is text that contains links to other texts or resources.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">How is "the web" related to the internet?</p>
                <pre>   The web is a subset of the internet.
    While the internet is the global network of interconnected devices,
    the web is a collection of interconnected documents and resources (websites) accessed via browsers using HTTP/HTTPS.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server
                    interaction.</p>
                <pre>   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a Protocol used for transferring web pages and other resources between clients and servers. When a client (browser) requests a webpage, the server responds with the requested data, and it displays content.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</p>
                <pre>    HTTP: Transfers data in plain text, making it less secure.
    HTTPS: Adds encryption to HTTP, ensuring secure communication and protecting data from interception.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web
                    2.0, and Web 3.0 generational prearadigms.</p>
                <pre>    Web 1.0 (1990s): Static websites with read-only content. Users could only consume information.
    Web 2.0 (2000s): Interactive and dynamic websites. Users could create, share, and collaborate (social media, blogs).
    Web 3.0 (Emerging): Decentralized, intelligent web powered by AI, blockchain, and semantic technologies. Focuses on user ownership and personalized experiences.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</p>
                <pre>    Web 1.0: Static, read-only, limited user interaction.
    Web 2.0: Dynamic, user-generated content, social interaction.
    Web 3.0: Decentralized, AI-driven, user-controlled data.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</p>
                <pre>   Markup languages (HTML) structure and format content on web pages, enabling browsers to display text, images, and other elements correctly.</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages.</p>
                <pre>    Markup Languages: Define structure and presentation (HTML, XML).
    Scripting Languages: Add interactivity and functionality (JavaScript, Python).</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="q">Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible
                    markup Language (XML), Hypertext markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext markup Language
                    (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</p>
